# bastra-recall — Homebrew formula (live tap copy)
#
# `url` / `sha256` are bumped automatically by
# .github/workflows/update-formula.yml on every stable release of
# n0mad-ai/bastra-recall — do not edit those two lines by hand.
#
# Everything else (build steps, bin shims, caveats) is still authored in
# distribution/homebrew/bastra-recall.rb in the bastra-recall repo and has to
# be copied over here by hand. The two drifted apart once (the tap sat on
# v0.7.6 and was missing six of the seven hook shims); keep them in lockstep.
#
# Install via:
#   brew tap n0mad-ai/tap
#   brew trust n0mad-ai/tap   # current brew refuses untrusted third-party taps
#   brew install bastra-recall
#   bastra install all

      Finish setup with:
        bastra install all

      That registers bastra-recall with every supported AI client
      (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor) and verifies the install.

      The MCP forwarder auto-starts the daemon on first use. To start it
      eagerly for REST clients:
        bastra-recall &

      Vault path: pass --vault, set BASTRA_VAULT_PATH, or let the CLI
      auto-detect from an existing claude.json registration.
